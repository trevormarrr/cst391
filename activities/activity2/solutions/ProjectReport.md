## Part 1: Tools Installation



### 1. Install Angular CLI:
- On Windows, open up a Command Prompt, or on Mac, open up the Terminal application and run the following command (Note: on Mac, you may need to run as sudo):

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
- Verify the version of Angular by running the following command and then take a screenshot:

````bash
ng version
````

### 2. Create a test application to validate the environment:
- In the Terminal, navigate to the location where you want the test application to be created.
- Run the following Angular CLI command and select the Angular route and CSS options during the installation:

````bash
ng new testapp
````

- Create a VS Code Workspace by performing the following steps:
- Open VS Code. Close the existing Workspace if one is opened.
- Click the App Workspace Folder hyperlink from the VS Code start screen.
- Select the testapp directory where the test application was created.
- Select the File > Save Workspace As menu options and save your Workspace so VS Code can be opened again in the future.
- Open the internal Terminal in VS Code and run the following command to start the Node server. Your browser should automatically be started with the application running. Take a screenshot.

````bash
ng serve -o
````

- Open the Component `app.component.ts` file in VS Code. Notice that the default `index.html` page is rendering this Component by using the `<app-root>` tag, which is specified in the Components selector property and templateUrl properties that are both specified in the `@Component` decorator. Also notice that the title variable from the Component is referenced in the Component Template using the syntax `{{ title }}`. Change the value of the title variable. Validate that the application is automatically refreshed in your browser. Take a screenshot.

- Modify the Component `app.component.ts` file by adding a new class member variable named message and set this value to your name. Render this value in an h3 Html tag in the Component Template. Take a screenshot.

### 3. Research:
- Inspect the default test project structure created in the Activity. Describe the purpose for each of the folders of the following in the project structure: `node_modules`, `src`, `src/app`, `src/assets`, and `src/environments`. Also, describe the purpose for each of the following files in the project: `angular.json`, `package.json`, and `tsconfig.json`.

| Directory or File  | Purpose                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node_modules`     | The directoy where all the installed npm/node module source code lives.                                                                      |
| `src`              | The main source folder for the application, containing all the source code, templates, and assets.                                           |
| `src/app`          | The folder where the core functionality of the app is stored, including components, services, and modules.                                   |
| `src/assets`       | A folder for storing static assets like images, stylesheets, fonts, and other resources needed by the app.                                   |
| `src/environments` | A folder for storing environment-specific configuration files, such as development and production settings.                                  |
| `angular.json`     | The configuration file for Angular CLI, used to define build, serve, and test settings for the application.                                  |
| `package.json`     | The file that defines the project’s dependencies, scripts, and metadata, including versioning and other configurations.                      |
| `tsconfig.json`    | The TypeScript configuration file that specifies the compiler options and the files to be included or excluded from the compilation process. |

- Inspect the page source for the default page displayed when running the test project. Explain how the resultant page was generated by Angular by providing a brief overview and purpose for each of the following files: `main.ts`, `app.component.css`, `app.component.html`, `app.component.ts`, and `app.module.ts`.

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.ts`            | The entry point for the Angular application, where the root module (`AppModule`) is bootstrapped to start the app. It usually calls `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)`.                                       |
| `app.component.css`  | The stylesheet for the root component (`AppComponent`), containing the styles that will be applied to the component's HTML template.                                                                                             |
| `app.component.html` | The HTML template for the root component (`AppComponent`), which defines the layout and structure of the page displayed.                                                                                                         |
| `app.component.ts`   | The TypeScript file for the root component (`AppComponent`), defining the component's logic, such as data binding, event handling, and interaction with the app's services.                                                      |
| `app.module.ts`      | The root module that defines and configures the app's components, services, and other Angular-specific functionality (such as imports for forms, routing, etc.). This is the module that Angular uses to launch the application. |

**Overview of Page Generation:**
1. **`main.ts`** initializes the Angular application by bootstrapping the `AppModule`.
2. **`app.module.ts`** registers the components and services that are part of the Angular application.
3. **`app.component.ts`** defines the component that Angular will render and bind to the HTML defined in `app.component.html`.
4. **`app.component.html`** provides the layout of the page, which is rendered by Angular based on the logic in `app.component.ts`.
5. **`app.component.css`** applies styles to the HTML template to make the page visually appealing and consistent with the design.

*This is all my own work, all answers were my own thoughts and i did not use any external sources to find information or answers for this assignement or research questions. I have lots of expeirence with Angular so this comes pretty easy to me.*
